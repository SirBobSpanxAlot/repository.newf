# chinook (plugin.video.chinook)

chinook is a multi-source addon for Kodi with the added ability to install custom provider modules. Unlike other Kodi addons which are generally built for a single service use, chinook allows users to connect to multiple online/offline services at once for their viewing with a single click.
