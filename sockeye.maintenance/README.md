# THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT.

OpenWizard was created to help the Kodi community out and help get rid of the broken personal wizards that are floating around. As this is a work in progress, a repository is highly recommended, but if you prefer not to, there is a built-in auto-updater.
