# FAQ
> ### What is chinook?

chinook is a multi-source addon for Kodi with the added ability to install custom provider modules. Unlike other Kodi addons which are generally built for a single service use, chinook allows users to connect to multiple online/offline services at once for their viewing with a single click.

> ### How do I install a new provider?

In the settings menu of chinook you will find a providers tab. Inside this tab you will find the install provider package option.

> ### How do manage my providers?

Within chinook's settings, you will find the providers tab. Within this tab you can disable/enable single providers inside provide packs, enable/disable entire provider packages, enable/ disable automatic provider updates and manually for a update check for your providers.

> ### chinook won't show me season or episode lists and instead begins playing automatically?

Please disable the Auto Episode Resume setting in the general tab of chinook's settings.

> ### My Settings reset? What happened?
This is a known bug that is generally caused by a setting being set to often by threads in chinook. This issue should be addressed within the Beta update 0.1.25. Please ensure you are on a version on/above this.
If you continue to have issues, please provide a kodi log in this github issue -> https://github.com/Newf276/plugin.video.seren/issues/18

> ### I'm experiencing an issue whilst using chinook. Where can I get help?
You can often find help from users in the Addons4Kodi subreddit or you are always welcome to log a github issue and I will contact you directly to investigate the issue.

> ### Can I use chinook to illegally view copyrighted material?

I will not, and nor will I condone the use of chinook or any custom providers to view illegal copyright content. No assistance will be given to any user that I identify to be using chinook for illegal purposes. Please respect copyrighted work and any laws applicable to yourself whilst using chinook.
